Status values:

- `Not started`
- `In progress`
- `Blocked`
- `Done`

## Automatic Status Updates

The [`Mainnet Checklist Status`](../.github/workflows/mainnet-checklist-status.yml) workflow scans links in this file when an issue is closed or when maintainers run it manually. If a row links to a closed issue in this repository, the workflow changes that row's status to `Done` and opens a pull request with the generated update.

Rows linked to documents, workflows, external repositories, or new-issue templates still require manual maintainer review.

## Maintainer Sign-off

Mainnet launch requires sign-off from the core maintainers below after every checklist item is `Done` or has an explicitly accepted launch exception.

| Security lead | TBD |  |  |
| Infrastructure lead | TBD |  |  |
| SDK lead | TBD |  |  |
